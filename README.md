# Psychic-Game

    **This is a work in progress; as of Sunday afternoon, the files are in disarray, reflecting multiple attempts at a solution. 

    **But if you pay attention to the release notes, and the other examples, I think the reader/grader can see that I've learned a lot with this simple exercise that took multiple attempts over multiple days totalling many hour of coding, reading, and watching tutorials for guidance.

- Sunday PM (early) Update: I think I have a working version! There are still some defects in the application (**start with iexample.html** with **igame.js**);
    * Wrapping game play into a function (partial or full) seemed like a good idea, but the results were buggy, so I CTRL-Z'd my way back to the orginal working structure
    * No CSS used to format, but I was more concerned about the game logic and then writing updates to the page dynamically
    * No Uppercase to Lowercase conversion implemented, so the app will rely on the user input of lowercase keystrokes (not a good design)
    
- Sunday AM Update: I have added an extended version of the simple number guess game; ext-index.html + simple-ext.js; So far, I have not gotten anything but the simple number game to work, but the TA-grader can view my logic and thinking in the code if there are no more updates to the release notes.
- I am walking away to try to regain some perspective and in hopes of simplifying my logic and code into an easily digestable form.

- Saturday PM update: I will update on Sunday as time permits me to complete the assignment in full
- WHERE IT STANDS NOW (2 parts)
    + index.html + game.js are temporarily abandoned so I could work on a simpler prototype,
    + simpleindex.html + simple.js is a numbers-based prototype of the letters guessing game
    + once 'simple' prototype is complete, (in theory) I just have to add the array of letters
