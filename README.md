# Psychic-Game

*** This is a work in progress ***

- Sunday AM Update: I have added an extended version of the simple number guess game; ext-index.html + simple-ext.js; So far, I have not gotten anything but the simple number game to work, but the TA-grader can view my logic and thinking in the code if there are no more updates to the release notes.
- I am walking away to try to regain some perspective and in hopes of simplifying my logic and code into an easily digestable form.

- I will update on Sunday as time permits me to complete the assignment in full
- WHERE IT STANDS NOW (2 parts)
    + index.html + game.js are temporarily abandoned so I could work on a simpler prototype,
    + simpleindex.html + simple.js is a numbers-based prototype of the letters guessing game
    + once 'simple' prototype is complete, (in theory) I just have to add the array of letters
